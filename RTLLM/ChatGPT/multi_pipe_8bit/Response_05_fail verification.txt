Sure, let's plan the 16-bit full adder according to your thinking chain.

Step 1: Design the 8-bit adder

We will divide the 16-bit adder into two 8-bit adders. Therefore, for each half of the input, we will need to create a separate 8-bit adder and then concatenate the results.

Step 2: Instantiate 8-bit adders

We will instantiate two 8-bit adders (let's name them adder_l and adder_h) for the high and low halves of the input respectively.

Step 3: Connect the 8-bit adders to generate the final output

We will connect the high half result (addend_l) and low half result (addend_h) with the carry-in and use concatenation to create the final output.

Now let's see the Verilog code implementation:

```verilog
module adder_8bit(input [7:0] a, b, input c_in, output reg [7:0] sum, output c_out);
    always @(*) begin
        sum = a + b + c_in;
        c_out = sum[8];
    end
endmodule

module adder_16bit(input [15:0] a, b, input c_in, output reg [15:0] y, output reg Co);
    reg [7:0] addend_l, addend_h;

    adder_8bit adder_l(.a(a[7:0]), .b(b[7:0]), .c_in(c_in), .sum(addend_l), .c_out(Co));
    adder_8bit adder_h(.a(a[15:8]), .b(b[15:8]), .c_in(Co), .sum(addend_h), .c_out());

    always @(*) begin
        y = {addend_h, addend_l};
    end
endmodule
```

In this design, we have two 8-bit adders (adder_l and adder_h) for the high and low halves of the input. The carry-in for adder_l is the carry-out of adder_h, and the carry-out for adder_h is the Co output of the adder_16bit module. The results of adder_l and adder_h are concatenated to create the final output y[15:0].s
